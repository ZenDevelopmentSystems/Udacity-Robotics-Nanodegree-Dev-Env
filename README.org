* Deps

- Requires Vagrant 1.9.1 (should work on other versions but not tested)
- VirtualBox 5.1


* Usage

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
vagrant up
#+END_SRC

This will automatically create a virtual machine running Ubuntu Trusty 64 bits 
and install the environment described in [[https://github.com/udacity/RoboND-Python-StarterKit/blob/master/doc/configure_via_anaconda.md][the course documentation.]]

Then hit the following command to get into the virtual machine:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
vagrant ssh 
#+END_SRC

Then you'll need to activate the =conda= environment using 
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
source activate RoboND
#+END_SRC
